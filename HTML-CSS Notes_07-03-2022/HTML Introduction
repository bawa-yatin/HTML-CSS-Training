Introduction to HTML:-

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard markup language for which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling. With the help of HTML, we can only create static web pages. In order to make it functional or dynamic in nature we make use of JavasScript. HTML describes the structure of a Web page and can consists a series of elements. HTML elements basically tells the browser how to display the content. The latest version of HTML is HTML5. Consider the example below:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Web page title</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>This is some demo content.</p>
</body>

</html>

Explanation of above example:-

a) <!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type and tells the browser about the version of HTML.

b) <html > :This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document and acts as a container for all the HTML elements. Text between html tag describes the web document.

c) <head>: It is the first element inside the <html> element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). It must be closed before the body tag opens.

d) <title>: It is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately.

e) <body> : Text between body tag describes the content of the page that will be visible to the end user. This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.

f) <h1> : These are heading tags which we can display on our webpage. HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

g) <p> : The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Many new elements are added in HTML5 like nav, audio, figcaption, progress, command, time, datalist, video, figure, meter, data, section, time, aside, canvas, summary, rp, rt, details, wbr, header, footer, keygen, embed, article etc.

Difference between HTML and HTML5:-

1) HTML didnâ€™t support audio and video without the use of flash player support whereas HTML5 supports audio and video controls with the use of <audio> and <video> tags.
2) HTML does not allow JavaScript to run in browser whereas HTML5 Allows JavaScript to run in background.This is possible due to JS Web worker API in HTML5.
3) HTML uses cookies to store temporary data whereas HTML5 uses SQL databases and application cache to store offline data which is a much more secure approachs.
4) It is not possible to draw shapes like circle, rectangle, triangle etc in HTML whereas HTML5 allows to draw shapes like circle, rectangle, triangle etc through new introduced HTML5 elements.
5) Older version of HTML are less mobile-friendly whereas HTML5 language is more mobile-friendly.

Types of HTML ELements:-

An HTML file is basically a collection of elements which are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. We have 3 types of HTML elements:-

a) Block-level element:- A block-level element always start with new line and takes the full width of web page. These elements are responsible for structuring the main part of the web page by dividing the page into blocks. Some of the commonly used block-level elements include "<address>, <article>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <canvas>, <dd>, <div>, <dl>, <dt>, <fieldset>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <form>, <h1>-<h6>, <header>, <hr>, <li>, <main>, <nav>, <section>, <table>, <tfoot>, <ul> and <video>". Example:- 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
</head>

<body>
    <div style="background-color: red">My first div.</div>
    <div style="background-color: yellow">My second div</div>
    <!-- style attribute is used for styling the HTML content. -->
    <p style="background-color: orange">This is a block level element</p>
</body>

</html>

b) Inline Elements:- These elements does not start with new line and take width as per requirement and are mostly used with other elements. Some of the commonly used inline elements include "<a>, <abbr>, <acronym>, <b>, <bdo>, <big>, <br>, <button>, <cite>, <code>, <dfn>, <em>, <i>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>,<script>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <textarea>, <time>". Example:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- href attribute is used to specify the link of the page on
    which user should be redirected after clicking. -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Go to Google</a>
    <span style="background-color: brown">This is an inline element.</span>
</body>

</html>

c) Void Elements- These elements do not have a closing tag and also no content can be embedded inside them. Some of the commonly used void elements include <br> (represents a line break) , <hr>(represents a horizontal line) etc.

HTML Tags:-

1) HTML Anchor Tag (<a>)- It defines a hyperlink that links one page to another page. It can create hyperlink to other web page as well as files, location, or any URL. The most important attribute of this tag is the "href" attribute which links one page or file with another.
We also have an attribute known as "target" which we can use to open the linked page in another tab rather in the same tab. In order to acheive that we specify the value of "target" attribute as "_blank". Example:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title></title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Click on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank"> this-link </a>to go on home page of Udemy.</p>
</body>

</html>

2) <b> Tag- This tag is responsible for making our text "bold", but the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate as per HTML5 specification. Example:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <p>This is plain text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>
</body>

</html>

3) <article> Tag- The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content. This tag is generally used on Forum post, Blog post, News story, comment etc. Also this element is a block-level element. Example:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Article Tag</title>
</head>

<body>

    <article>
        <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>

      Your browser does not support the html audio tag.
    </audio>
</body>

</html>

5) Button Tag- The <button> tag is used to create a clickable button within HTML form on our webpage. We can put content like text or image within the <button>........</button> tag. We should always specify the type attribute for a <button> tag. HTML Button tag can be used inside and outside the form. If we use it inside the form, it works as the submit button. We can also use it as reset button. Some common attributes that can be specified with the "button" tag include:-

6) Canvas Tag- The HTML 5 <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics using scripting language like JavaScript. A canvas is a rectangle like area on an HTML page. The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics, we require a scripting language to draw graphics like paths, boxes, circles, text and add images. It is always necessary to specify the id attribute and the height & width attribute to define the size of the canvas. Example:-

<!DOCTYPE >
<html>

<body>
    <!-- border property in style attribute is used to draw a border
    as by default canvas doesn't have one. -->
    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="200" style="border: 2px solid">
      Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.
    </canvas>
</body>

</html>

<html>

<body>
